\section{Conventions}

$C$\newline
$\gamma$ Command\newline
$\epsilon$ Expression\newline
$\rho$ Environment\newline
$\sigma$ Store\newline
$\theta$ Store Transformation from $S \rightarrow S$\newline
$S$ Domain of Machine States (Stores)\newline
$\S$ and $\S|$ Statement brackets (equivalent to Algol 60â€™s begin and end)
$\delta$ The typical element of both E (Domain of Expression Results) and D (Domain of values which can be denoted by Identifiers)
$\kappa$ An individual expression continuation within K (Domain of expression continuations)

Typing of functions is done as such

\begin{align*}
F : [a -> b]
G : [b -> [c -> d]]
g \circ f : [a -> d]
\end{align*}

Braces will be used to delimit continuations for readability.

\section{The problem of jumps}

In the semantics given in [13] the value of a command is a function which transforms the store, so that, in symbolic terms\newline

$C\llbracket\gamma\rrbracket(\rho) = \theta$\newline

where $C$ is the semantic function mapping commands to their meaning, $\gamma$ is a command, $\rho$ the environment which gives the denotations associated with the identifiers in $\gamma$ and $\theta$ is a store transformation, i.e.\newline

$\theta \in C = [S \rightarrow S]$\newline

where $S$ is the domain of machine states (or stores). We use the double brackets $\llbracket \rrbracket$ as an aid to the eye to separate the program text $\gamma$ from the value domain expression which form the rest of the equation.

\subsection{Sequencing}

The normal sequence of commands is then naturally interpreted as performing one store transformation after another, so that the overall effect is that of functional composition.
Thus, if we have two commands $\gamma_0$ and $gamma_1$ with store transformations given by\newline

$\theta_0 = C\llbracket \gamma_0 \rrbracket (\rho)$

$\theta_1 = C\llbracket \gamma_1 \rrbracket (\rho)$\newline

The effect of the sequence of commands $\gamma_0 ; \gamma_1$ on any initial store $\sigma$ will be to produce a store\newline

$\sigma^{'} = \theta_1 ( \theta_2 (\sigma))$

so that the semantic equations take the form (compositionally)\newline

$C\llbracket \gamma_0 ;\gamma_1 \rrbracket (\rho) = (C\llbracket \gamma_1 \rrbracket(\rho))\circ (C\llbracket \gamma_0 \rrbracket(\rho))$\newline

This simple scheme breaks down if $\gamma_0$ contains a jump to some external label.

\subsection{valof-resultis construction}

Handling an error exit from a function (Algol 60: Type-procedure).

A jump may be called in the middle of evaluating an expression, while there may be several partial results.

We can avoid this unnecessary complication by using the \textbf{valof-resultis} construction.

In this we have an expression of the form \textbf{valof}$\gamma$ and a command of the form \textbf{resultis}$\epsilon$.

NOTE: $\gamma$ is a Command and $\epsilon$ is an expression.

\begin{verbatim}
data Expr = ... 
          | Valof Command

data Command = ...
             | Resultis Expr
\end{verbatim}

The value of an expression

\begin{alltt}
\textbf{valof}\(\S\gamma_0\)
      \(\gamma_1\)
      ...
      \textbf{resultis} \(\epsilon'\)
      ...
\end{alltt}

is found by obeying the commands $\gamma_0$,$\gamma_1$,... in a sequence until a command \textbf{resultis} $\epsilon'$ is obeyed.

The expression $\epsilon'$ is then evaluated and this value is taken as the value of the whole expression. All programming languages which allow functions to be defined have some construction which is semantically equivalent to this \textbf{resultis} command, but many languages restrict its use so that it gets confused with function definition.

The difficult type of jump is inside the body of a \textbf{valof} block to a label which is outside. The following is a small PL to illustrate the semantics of these jumps.

\section{A small "continuation" language}

\subsection {Syntactic Categories}
$\xi \in Id$ Usual Identifiers\newline
$\gamma \in Cmd$ Commands\newline
$\epsilon \in Exp$ Expressions\newline
$\phi \in Fn$ Some Primitive Commands\newline

\vspace{1.5cm}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{code}
data Store = Store

type Identifier = String
type Label = Identifier

data Command = Prim
             | Dummy Int
             | Sequence Command Command
             | IFE Expr Command Command
             | While Expr Command
             | CommandBlock [(Label, Command)]
             | ResultIs Expr
             deriving Show

data Expr = ELabel Label
          | ETrue
          | EFalse
          | Cond Expr Expr Expr
          | ValOf Command
            deriving Show

tx = Sequence (Dummy 0)
            $ Sequence (Dummy 1)
                  $ Sequence (Dummy 2) $ Dummy 3

ty = CommandBlock $ fmap (\i -> (show i, Dummy i)) [0..5]
\end{code}

\end{verbatim}

There is function, known as an environment which gives the mapping from identifiers to their denotations.

\begin{align*}
\rho \in Env = [Id \rightarrow D].
\end{align*}

\subsection{Continuations}

$\gamma$ as the store transformation $C\llbracket\gamma\rrbracket(\rho)$ crucially depends on the distinction between jump-free and jump-dependent commands.

This means we cannot find a satisfactory semantic equation for $C\llbracket\gamma_0;\gamma_1\rrbracket(\rho)$ because we cannot determine whether $\gamma_0$ is jump-free or not.

Instead we define a semantic function which yields, for every command $\gamma$, the state transformation from there to the end of the program.

This function will be $P$ instead of $C$.

In order to deal with the effect of the program following $\gamma$, we need to supply an extra argument, $\theta$, which is the state transformation corresponding to this part of the program. If $\gamma$ is jump-free, we shall then have for the program including $\gamma$

\begin{align*}
P\llbracket\gamma\rrbracket(\rho)(\theta) = \theta \circ C\llbracket\gamma\rrbracket(\rho)
\end{align*}

In other words the state transformation from $\gamma$ is performed first then the rest of the program, $\theta$.

$\theta$ is called a \emph{continuation} (strictly a \emph{command continuation}) and is of type $C = [\rightarrow]$

or

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{code}
type Cont = Store -> Store
\end{code}
\end{verbatim}

Thus the semantic function $P$ has the functionality.

\begin{align*}
P:[Cmd \rightarrow [Env \rightarrow [C \rightarrow [S \rightarrow S]]]]
\end{align*}

or

\begin{align*}
P:[Cmd \rightarrow [Env \rightarrow [C \rightarrow CONT]]]
\end{align*}

We will discuss $P\llbracket\gamma\rrbracket(\rho)(\theta)$ when $\gamma$ is jump-dependent later.

It is worth nothing that it does not need to depend on the argument $\theta$. It is possible to ignore the normal continuation for a command which is precisely what is needed for jumps.

Now lets take a look at a simple sequence $P\llbracket\gamma_0;\gamma_1\rrbracket\rho\theta$.

We carry out $\gamma_0$ (in the environment $\rho$).

Then follow it with the continuation which arises from carrying out $\gamma_1$ (in $\rho$) with the continuation $\theta$.

$\gamma_0$'s CONT = $P\llbracket\gamma_1\rrbracket\rho\theta$

$\gamma_1$'s CONT = $\theta$

\begin{align*}
P\llbracket\gamma_0;\gamma_1\rrbracket\rho\theta\sigma = P\llbracket\gamma_0\rrbracket\rho\{P\llbracket\gamma_1\rrbracket\rho\theta\}\sigma
\end{align*}

Now considering labels and jumps. The value of a label with be the state transformation from the labelled point to the end of the program (the rest of the program).

$P\llbracket\textbf{goto}\epsilon\rrbracket\rho\theta$ will simply ignore the original continuation $\theta$ and use the value of $\epsilon$ (the label) as the continuation.

\subsection{Expressions}

Expressions can now also yield both a (possibly altered) machine state and a result. The effect of the result however is not determiend by the expression itself but by its context.

This leads us to a new type of continuations, \emph{expression continuation}.

As arguments it takes the expression result, a state, and produces a final state.

$K = [E \rightarrow [S \rightarrow S]]$

$K = [E \rightarrow CONT]$

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{code}
type ECont = Expr -> Cont
\end{code}
\end{verbatim}

NOTE: $E$ is the domain of expression results. In this example it is the same as $D$ (the domain of values which can be denoted by identifiers) but this is a language detail (see ref [14]).

We shall use $\delta$ for the typical element of both $E$ and $D$ and $\kappa \in K$ for an individual expression continuation.

This leads to a semantic function for expressions denoted by $\mathcal{E}$

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{E} : [Exp \rightarrow [Env \rightarrow [K \rightarrow [S \rightarrow S]]]]
\end{align*}

For example

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{E}\llbracket tt \rrbracket\rho\kappa\sigma = \kappa(tt)\sigma\newline
\mathcal{E}\llbracket ff \rrbracket\rho\kappa\sigma = \kappa(ff)\sigma\newline
\end{align*}

For an identifier its almost equally simple

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{E}\llbracket\xi\rrbracket\rho\kappa\sigma = \kappa(\rho\llbracket\xi\rrbracket)\sigma
\end{align*}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{code}
data Env = Env

--Looks up an identifier in an environment
find :: Env -> Identifier -> Expr
find = undefined

insert :: Identifier -> Expr -> Env -> Env
insert = undefined

type K = Expr -> Cont

eval :: Expr -> Env -> K -> Store -> Store
eval (ETrue) env k store = k ETrue store
eval (EFalse) env k store = k EFalse store
eval (ELabel identifier) env k store = k (find env identifier) store
eval (Cond e p q) env k store = condk store
  where
    condk = eval e env (\e' s' -> case e' of
                                    ETrue -> eval p env k s'
                                    EFalse -> eval q env k s'
                                    _ -> error "Type Error: Cond expects tt or ff")



interpret :: Command -> Env -> Cont -> Cont
interpret = undefined

type KM = Expr -> Store -> IO Store
evalM :: Expr -> Env -> KM -> Store -> IO Store
evalM (ETrue) env k store = do
      print "evalM True"
      k ETrue store


\end{code}
\end{verbatim}
